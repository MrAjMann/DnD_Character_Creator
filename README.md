## Software Development Plan

### Statement of Purpose

**Description:**
This application is designed to help players of Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) create the story Characters. I wish to also provide quality information as to the pro's and cons of each Race,Class,Ability Scores and Equipment.

**The problem:**
The creation of D&D characters can often be a tedious process as there is many variables at play. This application is designed to take the guess work out of character creation and let the player focus on the creative aspect.

**Target Audience:**
My targeted user base is those interested in Dungeons and Dragons, players of all ages and skill levels.

**How To Use:**
As you start the application you will be greeted with a starting menu. This menu will display the options to _Create A New Character_, _View an Existing Character_, _Edit a Character_ and _Delete a Character_.

### Features

**API Integration:**
Access the ["D&D API"](https://www.dnd5eapi.co) to get Multiple streams of information based on where the user is in the character creation process. E.g the first API call is to retrieve a list of **Races**. E.g Druid, Tiefling, Human etc.
The second API call is for **Classes** E.g Warlock, Sorcerer, barbarian etc. Once the mvp is completed for the App then i want to add further calls to provide more information and allow further expansion of the character class.

**Create A D&D Character:**

**Delete A D&D Character:**
